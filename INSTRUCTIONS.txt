HOW TO START
-------------

1. You need to change the classpath in .bat files that looks like:
   C:\Users\Admin\IdeaProjects\AKTK\grammar\antlr-4.2-complete.jar
   to path, where you place the antlr-4.2-complete.jar file

2. Open cmd and launch .bat files in this order:
 antlr4
 grun
 generate

3. Now test the grammar (aVene.g4) using this command:
 test programm test_prog.vene


Try to put some different codes to test_prog.vene to ensure that it works
correctly. Now we have a mistake, that I can't solve yet. Feel free to help.

Let me know, if you there are problems with this procedure or grammar mistakes.
